# simpple documentation

`simpple` is a simple probabilistic programming language.
It provides common distributions, a Model class and utility functions to easily build and re-use models.
The goal of simpple is to bring some of the features from probabilistic programming languages such as PyMC and Numpyro for models that were not implemented with a tensor library such as PyTensor or JAX.
